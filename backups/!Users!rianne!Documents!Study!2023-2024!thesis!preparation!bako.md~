# BaKo (BAchelor KickOff meeting)

> Thursday 30 november 2023

The thesis can be combined with an internship of 3EC. There is information on that on BrightSpace.

Total time: 12 EC * 28 hours = 336 hours. Per week: 336 hours / 18 weeks = 19 hours per week. The tip is to make a time plan, so that you can plan when you work on the thesis.

On December 6 you can subscribe on Osiris. After reading the proposals in the document, you can indicate the top 5 preferred supervisors/projects in the form on BrightSpace. It opens on December 11 and closes January 8. There is also a general interests part, that can be used to choose between supervisors. Motivation is used to decide who gets which spot if there are hard choices.

You get assigned to a group of about 5 students, who write theses around one topic. There are regular meetings with the group.

Next to BrightSpace, also check the rules and regulations. There is a teams channel, where you can ask questions.

The student assistants organise workgroups. It is not mandatory, but you can work on your thesis there and ask for tips. You can give feedback and mention it if you'd like a particular topic to be discussed.

The time plan:
- In the first month, you formulate your proposal. It is quite a lot for in a month, but then you at least have a quick start.
- Around April 1, there is a progress checkpoint. If the supervisor thinks that you have put in not enough time or that the project just is too large, the project can be adapted or aborted.
- June 21 the thesis should be handed in.
- There is a defense at the end, not a presentation. This is to discover whether you actually know what you talk about and detect theses written by ChatGPT. 10 minute presentation, then some questions from friends and family (non-experts) and then in-depth questions from experts. It's 50 minutes in total.

The end-deadline is strict.

The grade is determined by 3 grades: the thesis, the defence and the process.

Look at old theses for examples and inspiration.

Look at the writing centre. Sometimes there are writing retreats in a monestary.

At the end of January the group distribution is updated and then you can start in February.


- Hartmut Fitz, _Supervised learning of sequential structure in spiking neural networks_
- Bryan da Costa Souza, _Hippocampal coactivation patterns and local field potential oscillations_
- Max Hinne, _More dubious ways of estimating the marginal likelihood_
- Eelke Spaak, _Cognitive computational neuroscience (somewhere in that realm)_
- Thomasin Coggins, _AI and the circulation of oppressive ideas_

I am thinking of doing the cognitive science research master, so I prefer a research project in that direction, to see if I would indeed like to do that. I do prefer something more theoretical above optimizing code.

I like interdisciplinary topics, and have followed courses on neurophysics, psychology (memory) and philosophy (cognition and ethics). Some of the supervisors I chose do have some of that. The project with Hartmut Fitz, that I put at the top spot, features cognition and neurobiology. Bryan da Costa Souza and Eelke Spaak both seemed to feature neuroscience and a bit of memory.

That explains 3 of the 5 supervisors. I chose Max Hinne because I enjoy Bayesian statistics and wouldn't mind a math-heavy thesis. Giulio Mecaci and Thomasin Coggins would be a more philosophy-directed thesis. I thought a subquestion of "AI and the circulation of oppressive ideas" was interesting, specifically: "If we agree that we should censor potentially offensive outputs produced by AI-powered technologies, how do we decide what counts as offensive?"
